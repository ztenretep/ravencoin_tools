<p align="justify">To access the Ravencoin Blockchain directly, a node must be installed and connected to the network.</p>

<p align="justify">You can use raven-4.3.2.1-x86_64-linux-gnu.zip for a basic installation. The node is started via ./ravend -daemon -maxconnections=10000.</p> 

<p align="justify">As soon as the node is connected, the blockchain can be accessed via python-ravencoinlib 0.2.2.</p>

<p align="justify">With the first scripts, I am trying to understand how to interact with the blockchain.</p>
